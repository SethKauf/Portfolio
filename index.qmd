Hi, my name is Seth!

I'm a data scientist living and working in New York City.

I've been in the field since 2021, though I've worked in related fields before then.

I am currently on track to finish my Master's in Statistics program at Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College.

This is my home portfolio page, where I show off some samples of my school and personal projects.

Feel free to browse this page to find:

* About Me

* School Projects and Reports

* Personal Projects
