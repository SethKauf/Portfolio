Hi, I'm Seth Kaufman, a data scientist living in New York.

I'm currently completing my Master's degree in Statistics with a Data Science focus at Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College.

```{r Baruch_Map[0], echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

if(!require("leaflet")){
  options(repos=c(CRAN="https://cloud.r-project.org"))
  install.packages("leaflet")
  stopifnot(require("leaflet"))
}

baruch_longitude <- -73.98333
baruch_latitude  <- +40.75028

leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, zoom=17) |>
  addPopups(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, 
            "I am a Master's student at <b>Baruch College</b>!")
```

I've always had a love for computers and math, so marrying the two as a data scientist was a no-brainer for me, though it took me a bit to get here.

My education started at SUNY Albany where I received a BA in Political Science in 2018. In 2019 I was working a job that allowed me to start getting more into data analysis. This eventually led me to the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/), a Data Science bootcamp based in NYC. I've now been working in the data science and analytics field for 4 years since completing Flatiron, with many more to come.

```{r DuoLingo_Streak_Function[1], echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(httr2)
library(jsonlite)

fetch_duo_streak <- function(username) {
  req <- request("https://www.duolingo.com/2017-06-30/users") |>
    req_url_query(username = username,
                  fields = "streak,streakData{currentStreak,previousStreak}}")
  
  resp <- req_perform(req)
  user <- resp_body_json(resp)$users[[1]]
  
  streak_len <- function(x) if (is.list(x) && !is.null(x$length)) as.integer(x$length) else 0L
  candidates <- c(as.integer(user$streak %||% 0L),
                  streak_len(user$streakData$currentStreak),
                  streak_len(user$streakData$previousStreak))
  max(candidates, na.rm = TRUE)
}

'%||%' <- function(x, y) if (is.null(x)) y else x

USERNAME <- "Sethars"
STREAK <- fetch_duo_streak(USERNAME)
STREAKF <- formatC(STREAK, format = "f", big.mark = ",", digits = 0)
```

On a more personal level, I love travelling and languages. My wife and I want to see and experience as much of the world as possible, including our honeymoon in Brazil and our recent summer vacation in Italy. English is my native language, though I have a very good working proficiency in Russian and some working proficiency in Hebrew. I am also currently trying to learn some Spanish, Portuguese and Italian on DuoLingo.

```{r DuoLingo_Streak_Call[1], echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
cat(sprintf("My current DuoLingo streak is %s days!\n", STREAKF))
```
